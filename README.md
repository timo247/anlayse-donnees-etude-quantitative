# Script for analysing online survey data

This detailed script has been created in order to count number of iterations of choices during an online survey made with Typebot.

A data sample from the survey is available in the data.json file.

The code is simple, and easily updatable in order to count any number of iteration of multiple choice responses, or in order to do more sophisticated opartions trough the data.
